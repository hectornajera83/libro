The present study provides a retrospective view of the FGT paper and the subsequent literature, as well as a brief discussion of future directions. We identify three categories of contributions: to measurement, to axiomatics, and to application. A representative subset of the literature generated by the FGT methodology is discussed and grouped according to this taxonomy. We show how the FGT paper has played a central role in several thriving literatures and has contributed to the design, implementation, and evaluation of prominent development programs; the breadth of its impact is evidenced by the many topics beyond poverty to which its methodology has been applied. We conclude with a selection of prospective research topics.},

	higher rates of unemployment and deteriorating conditions in the
	inner cities have concentrated attention in Britain, and elsewhere
	in Europe, upon the idea and exact meaning of â€˜deprivationâ€™.
	This scientific concept is used extensively not only in the analysis
	of social conditions but also, in an applied form, as an instrument
	of policy in allocating resources to particular regions, areas and
	services. This paper argues that the indicators which are chosen
	to represent the phenomenon are often unduly restricted and even
	involve double counting. As a result the distribution and severity
	of deprivation seems to be seriously misperceived and resources misallocated.
	A review of the available studies shows how the concept might be
	treated more coherently in relation to that of poverty. },

  abstract = {In poverty measurement, differential weighting aims to take into account the unequal importance of the diverse dimensions and aspects of poverty and to add valuable information that improves the classification of the poor and the not-poor. This practice, however, is in contention with both classical test theory and modern measurement theories, which state that high reliability is a necessary condition for consistent population classification, while differential weighting is not so. The literature needs a clear numerical illustration of the relationship between high/low reliability and good/poor population classification to dissolve this tension and assist applied researchers in the assessment of multidimensional poverty indexes, using different reliability statistics. This paper uses a Monte Carlo study based on factor mixture models to draw up a series of uni-and multidimensional poverty measures with different reliabilities and predefined groups. The article shows that low reliability results in a high proportion of the poor group erroneously classified as part of the not poor group. Therefore, reliability inspections should be a systematic practice in poverty measurement. The article provides guidelines for interpreting the effects of unreliability upon adequate population classification and suggest that the classification error of current unreliable multidimensional indexes is above 10{\%}.},

  abstract = {One of the main goals in poverty measurement is making comparisons of prevalence and severity across geographical units. This is attained by merely disaggregating the index in question. The underlying assumption is that comparisons across units are tenable, inasmuch as the same indicators are utilised for constructing the index. Nonetheless, in practice, this assumption is very rarely tested. From the statistical perspective, measurement invariance (MI) must hold for comparisons to be valid, and violations thereof indicate that a given poverty index measures different things across different countries, states, counties, etc. Consequently, differentials in severity and prevalence cannot be attributed exclusively to the underlying construct (i.e. poverty) but to factors not considered in the measure. This article tests whether MI holds for two indexes: the Mexican official multidimensional measure (MPM) and an adjusted multidimensional measure (MPM-A) that uses less severe thresholds. The analysis is conducted using a novel method called the `alignment method'. It uses these two measures and the method as an illustration of why it is vital to introduce MI tests into poverty measurement. The results suggest that partial strong MI holds for the official measure and MI is violated when the thresholds are adjusted. Partial strong MI guarantees making valid comparisons across the 32 states. Should the official measure requires to be updated with other thresholds, it would be necessary to adjust the threshold or drop the indicator for water deprivation.},

  abstract = {Information systems (IS) research frequently uses survey data to measure the interplay between technological systems and human beings. Researchers have developed sophisticated procedures to build and validate multi-item scales that measure latent constructs. The vast majority of IS studies uses classical test theory (CTT), but this approach suffers from three major theoretical shortcomings: (1) it assumes a linear relationship between the latent variable and observed scores, which rarely represents the empirical reality of behavioral constructs; (2) the true score can either not be estimated directly or only by making assumptions that are difficult to be met; and (3) parameters such as reliability, discrimination, location, or factor loadings depend on the sample being used. To address these issues, we present item response theory (IRT) as a collection of viable alternatives for measuring continuous latent variables by means of categorical indicators (i.e., measurement variables). IRT offers several advantages: (1) it assumes nonlinear relationships; (2) it allows more appropriate estimation of the true score; (3) it can estimate item parameters independently of the sample being used; (4) it allows the researcher to select items that are in accordance with a desired model; and (5) it applies and generalizes concepts such as reliability and internal consistency, and thus allows researchers to derive more information about the measurement process. We use a CTT approach as well as Rasch models (a special class of IRT models) to demonstrate how a scale for measuring hedonic aspects of websites is developed under both approaches. The results illustrate how IRT can be successfully applied in IS research and provide better scale results than CTT. We conclude by explaining the most appropriate circumstances for applying IRT, as well as the limitations of IRT.},

A differentiating feature of IRT modeling is the estimation of a mathematical function that relates individual differences on a continuous latent variable to the propensity to respond to a scale item (e.g., respond correctly to a multiple-choice aptitude item, or respond in category 3 on a five-point ordered rating scale). Commonly applied IRT models appropriate for dichotomous and polytomous item response data are described. Assumptions underlying these models and interpretation of indices derived from model parameters are presented. Finally, popular applications of IRT models, such as computerized adaptive testing, are summarized.},

  abstract            = {Background: Analysis of subgroups such as different ethnic, language,
	or education groups selected from among a parent population is common
	in health disparities research. One goal of such analyses is to examine
	measurement equivalence, which includes both qualitative review of
	the meaning of items as well as quantitative examination of different
	levels of factorial invariance and differential item functioning.
	Objectives: The purpose of this essay is to review the definitions
	and assumptions associated with factorial invariance, placing this
	formulation in the context of bias, fairness, and equity. The connection
	between the concepts of factorial invariance and item bias (differential
	item functioning) using a variant of item response theory is discussed.
	The situations under which different forms of invariance (weak, strong,
	and strict) are required are discussed. Methods: Establishing factorial
	invariance involves a hierarchy of levels that include tests of weak,
	strong, and strict invariance. Pattern (metric or weak) factorial
	invariance implies that the regression slopes are invariant across
	groups. Pattern invariance requires only invariant factor loadings.
	Strong factorial invariance implies that the conditional expectation
	of the response, given the common and specific factors, is invariant
	across groups. Strong factorial invariance requires that specific
	factor means (represented as invariant intercepts) also be identical
	across groups. Strict factorial invariance implies that, in addition,
	the conditional variance of the response, given the common and specific
	factors, is invariant across groups. Strict factorial invariance
	requires that, in addition to equal factor loadings and intercepts,
	the residual (specific factor plus error variable) variances are
	equivalent across groups. The concept of measurement invariance that
	is most closely aligned to that of item response theory considers
	the latent variable as a common factor measured by manifest variables;
	the specific factors can be characterized as nuisance variables.
	Conclusions: Invariance of factor loadings across studied groups
	is required for valid comparisons of scale score or latent variable
	means. Strong and strict invariance may be less important in the
	context of basic research in which group differences in specific
	factors are indicative of individual differences that are important
	for scientific exploration. However, for most applications in which
	the aim is to ensure fairness and equity, strict factorial invariance
	is required. Health disparities research often focuses on self-reported
	clinical outcomes such as quality of life that are not observed directly.
	Latent variable models such as factor analyses are central to establishing
	valid assessment of such outcomes.},

This definition leads to a more complete analysis than does the conventional one; Spearman's contention is verified that the conventional approach---which was formulated by Yule---introduces unnecessary hypotheses. It is emphasized that at least two trials are necessary to estimate the reliability coefficient. This paper is devoted largely to developinglower bounds to the reliability coefficient that can be computed from but asingle trial; these avoid the experimental difficulties of making two independent trials. Six different lower bounds are established, appropriate for different situations. Some of the bounds are easier to compute than are conventional formulas, and all the bounds assume less than do conventional formulas. The terminology used is that of psychological and sociological testing, but the discussion actually provides a general analysis of the reliability of the sum ofn variables.},

  abstract = {Following a general approach due to Guttman, coefficient$\alpha$ is rederived as a lower bound on the reliability of a test. A necessary and sufficient condition under which equality is attained in this inequality and hence that$\alpha$ is equal to the reliability of the test is derived and shown to be closely related to the recent redefinition of the concept of parallel measurements due to Novick. This condition is then also shown to be closely related to the unit rank assumption originally adopted by Kuder and Richardson in the derivation of their formula 20. The assumption later adopted by Jackson and Ferguson and the one adopted by Gulliksen are shown to be related to the necessary and sufficient condition derived here. It is then pointed out that the statement that ``coefficient$\alpha$ is equal to the mean of the split-half reliabilities'' is true only under the restricted condition assumed by Cronbach in the body of his derivation of this result. Finally some limitations on the uses of any function of$\alpha$ as a measure of internal consistency are noted.},

It summarises the main results of the in-depth analysis of these two datasets, identifies an optimal set of robust children MSD items and recommends a child-specific MSD indicator for use by EU countries and the European Commission in their regular social monitoring. In doing this, the paper replicates and expands on the methodological framework outlined in Guio et al. (2012, 2016), particularly by including additional advanced reliability tests.},

  abstract = { In June 2010, European Union (EU) Heads of State and Government adopted a social inclusion target as part of the new ‘Europe 2020 Strategy’: to lift at least 20 million people in the EU from the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020. One of the three indicators used to monitor progress towards this target is the EU indicator of severe material deprivation (MD). A main limitation of this indicator is the weak reliability of some of the items it is based on. For this reason, a thematic module on MD was included in the 2009 wave of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey. This article assesses the 2009 EU-SILC MD data and proposes an analytical framework for developing robust EU MD indicators. It carries out a systematic item by item analysis at both EU and country levels to identify the MD items which satisfactorily meet suitability, validity, reliability and additivity criteria across the EU. This approach has resulted in a proposed 13-item MD indicator covering some key aspects of living conditions which are customary across the whole EU covering a broad range of basic (food, clothes, shoes, etc.) as well as social (Internet, regular leisure activities, etc.) necessities. },

We discuss the issue of adaptive preferences, which has previously been used to criticise the consensual approach, and provide evidence to contest the claim that the poor adjust their aspirations downwards.},

Without further assumption the reliability of a test is defined. Parallel measurements are then independently defined, and the concept of replication is explicated. The derived axioms of the classical test theory model are then stated in a refined form of Woodbury's stochastic process notation, and the basic results of this model are derived. The assumptions of experimental independence, homogeneity of error distribution, and conditional independence are related to the classical model and to each other. Finally, a brief sketch of some stronger models assuming the independence of error and true scores or the existence of higher-order moments of error distributions or those making specific distributional assumptions is given.},

To provide comparisons and a worked example of item- and scale-level evaluations based on three psychometric methods used in patient-reported outcome development—classical test theory (CTT), item response theory (IRT), and Rasch measurement theory (RMT)—in an analysis of the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (VFQ-25).
Methods
Baseline VFQ-25 data from 240 participants with diabetic macular edema from a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial were used to evaluate the VFQ at the total score level. CTT, RMT, and IRT evaluations were conducted, and results were assessed in a head-to-head comparison.
Results
Results were similar across the three methods, with IRT and RMT providing more detailed diagnostic information on how to improve the scale. CTT led to the identification of two problematic items that threaten the validity of the overall scale score, sets of redundant items, and skewed response categories. IRT and RMT additionally identified poor fit for one item, many locally dependent items, poor targeting, and disordering of over half the response categories.
Conclusions
Selection of a psychometric approach depends on many factors. Researchers should justify their evaluation method and consider the intended audience. If the instrument is being developed for descriptive purposes and on a restricted budget, a cursory examination of the CTT-based psychometric properties may be all that is possible. In a high-stakes situation, such as the development of a patient-reported outcome instrument for consideration in pharmaceutical labeling, however, a thorough psychometric evaluation including IRT or RMT should be considered, with final item-level decisions made on the basis of both quantitative and qualitative results.},
